# financial-dashboad-Heineken-ABInBev
Final academic project (individual) for *"Data Visualization"*, a curricular course attended throughout the fall semester of my second master's degree in *Business Analytics* at Hult International Business School. 
The Heineken and AB InBev *financial performances* have been compared through the creation of an *attractive financial dashboard*. After having showcased similarities and differences of the main *KPIs*, three *recommendations* have been given to suggest for which company "look-out for".  Moreover, a second dashboard has been created to showcase the main strengths of the chosen company. This project helped me to *improve my skills* in the following *areas*:
- Data Collection
- Data Analysis 
- Financial Analysis 
- KPIs recognition 
- Financial Dashboard Creation
